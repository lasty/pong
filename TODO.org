- [DONE] dispatch inputs and updates as per gamestate::state enum
- [DONE] Menu system?
  - [DONE] Start, exit
- GUI notifications
  - Level n and ready before start
  - Game over / game win
  - [DONE] in game pause menu (exit, restart, reset ball)
- Win game sound/message
- Particle trail for ball traveling


# Refactor
- [TODO] Simplify the main update functions .. this is getting too complicated
- Clean up structs (eg, there are a lot of make-xyz that should be constructors
- Clean up sound code
  - Single point of call inside Game class  (able to handle volumes or mute)
- Clean up menu code
  - Maybe refactor out menus to separate class or state variable
  - Repeated strings
- There is a lot of duplicated code (eg reset ball)
- Input clean up
  - collapse player input, and intent type into intent, and/or rename


# Bugs
- Ball straight up hits a 45 degree block, will go left and right indefinitely
- Ball increases velocity when bouncing off paddle (normalize vector)
- New game resets mute sound setting

## Todo Low Priority
- [TODO] Watch more of those videos
- Level load/save/editor ?
- Maybe add more varieties in sound
- Add readme.md for github


## Other Ideas

- Project limits, use no textures, only coloured vertexes?
