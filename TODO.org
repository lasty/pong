- command/key to enable debug lines
- [DONE] resize redraws border lines
- [DONE] Refactor and clean up code again  (move things to maths, collision routines out of game class)

- Gameish
  - [DONE] Arrange blocks in grid formation for test level
  - Change player to paddle rect
  - Paddle follow mouse cursor X position
  - Fire straight up from paddle
  - Eventually deflect on paddle

  - Remove ball from bottom of screen
    - Rework simple collision checks for out of bounds balls


## Todo Low Priority

## Done!



## Other Ideas

- Project limits, use no textures, only coloured vertexes?
