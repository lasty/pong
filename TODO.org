- [DONE] Fire up from paddle
  - [DONE] Get velocity from last (few?) frames, add to ball initial velocity
  - [DONE] have a ghost ball ontop of the paddle when ready to fire


# Gameish
  - Win/Lose conditions
    - have maximum ball count?
    - New level when all blocks cleared
  - Level load/save/editor ?


# Refactor
- [DONE] Read/watch: unidirectional user interface architecture
- [TODO] Try to implement Model/View/Intent style system
  - [DONE] Input class should return an intent
  - [DONE] Game/Update should be pure, take an intent, output new state
  - [DONE] Render takes game state


## Todo Low Priority
- [TODO] Watch more of those videos
- [TODO] Investigate atom clang-format
- Particles class
- Do particles when block destroyed
- Maybe add more varieties in sound



## Other Ideas

- Project limits, use no textures, only coloured vertexes?
