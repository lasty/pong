- dispatch inputs and updates as per gamestate::state enum
- [TODO] Menu system?
  - Start, exit
- GUI notifications
  - Level n  and ready before start
  - Game over
  - in game pause menu (exit, restart, reset ball)
- Win game sound/message


# Refactor
- [TODO] Simplify the main update functions .. this is getting too complicated
- Clean up sound code
- Celan up menu code
- There is a lot of duplicated code (eg reset ball)


# Bugs
- Ball straight up hits a 45 degree block, will go left and right indefinitely
- Ball increases velocity when bouncing off paddle (normalize vector)


## Todo Low Priority
- [TODO] Watch more of those videos
- Level load/save/editor ?
- Maybe add more varieties in sound


## Other Ideas

- Project limits, use no textures, only coloured vertexes?
