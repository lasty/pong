- Win/Lose conditions
  - have maximum ball count?
  - New level when all blocks cleared
- [DONE] Limit paddle x range (goes off screen)
- Change shader to take vertex colours
- Particles class
- Do particles when block destroyed
- Text rendering
  - vector font, like 7 segment display



# Refactor
- [DONE] Read/watch: unidirectional user interface architecture
- [TODO] Try to implement Model/View/Intent style system
  - [DONE] Input class should return an intent
  - [DONE] Game/Update should be pure, take an intent, output new state
  - [DONE] Render takes game state


## Todo Low Priority
- [TODO] Watch more of those videos
- [TODO] Investigate atom clang-format
- Level load/save/editor ?
- Maybe add more varieties in sound



## Other Ideas

- Project limits, use no textures, only coloured vertexes?
