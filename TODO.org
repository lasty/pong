- command/key to enable debug lines
- Change player to paddle rect
- Paddle follow mouse cursor X position
- Fire up from paddle
  - Get velocity from last (few?) frames, add to ball initial velocity


- Gameish

  - Remove ball from bottom of screen
    - Rework simple collision checks for out of bounds balls
  - Win/Lose conditions
  - New level
  - Level load/save/editor ?


## Todo Low Priority
- [TODO] Watch more of those videos
- [TODO] Investigate atom clang-format
- Particles class
- Do particles when block destroyed
- Maybe add more varieties in sound



## Done!



## Other Ideas

- Project limits, use no textures, only coloured vertexes?
