- [DONE] Particles class
- Pass around list of collision events somehow
  - For each collision
    - Add particles on collision
    - Add Sounds on collision
- Do particles when block destroyed
- Text rendering
  - vector font, like 7 segment display
- Have paddle intersections apply velocity of paddle to the ball
- Win game sound/message
- Rework block rendering (Draw fill then outline, in static buffer)


# Refactor
- Have a pass at TODO comments
- see if possible to have sound play commands in one place
- state graph calls to set state and reset timer in one expression
- Pull out data clump vao/buffer in Renderer.cpp
- [TODO] Move tests to another file and test in cmakelists
- Add line width to glstate thing?

# Bugs
- Ball straight up hits a 45 degree block, will go left and right indefinitely


## Todo Low Priority
- [TODO] Watch more of those videos
- Level load/save/editor ?
- Maybe add more varieties in sound


## Other Ideas

- Project limits, use no textures, only coloured vertexes?
