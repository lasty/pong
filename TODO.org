
# Todo List
* GUI notifications
* Level n and ready before start
* Game over / game win
* Win game sound/message
* Particle trail for ball traveling


# Refactor
* TODO Simplify the main update functions .. this is getting too complicated
* TODO Clean up structs (eg, there are a lot of make-xyz that should be constructors

* Clean up sound code
**  Single point of call inside Game class  (able to handle volumes or mute)

* Clean up menu code
**  Maybe refactor out menus to separate class or state variable
**  Repeated strings

* There is a lot of duplicated code (eg reset ball)

* Input clean up
**  collapse player input, and intent type into intent, and/or rename


# Bugs
* Ball straight up hits a 45 degree block, will go left and right indefinitely
* Ball increases velocity when bouncing off paddle (normalize vector)
* New game resets mute sound setting


## Todo Low Priority
* TODO Watch more of those videos
* Level load/save/editor ?
* Maybe add more varieties in sound
* Add readme.md for github


## Other Ideas

- Project limits, use no textures, only coloured vertexes?
