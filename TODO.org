- Particles class
- Do particles when block destroyed
- Text rendering
  - vector font, like 7 segment display
- Have paddle intersections apply velocity of paddle to the ball
- Win game sound/message
- Rework block rendering (Draw fill then outline, in static buffer)


# Refactor
- [DONE] Go through and rename badly named functions/variables/enums
- [DONE] Eliminate commented/dead code
- Have a pass at TODO comments
- see if possible to have sound play commands in one place
- state graph calls to set state and reset timer in one expression


# Bugs
- Ball straight up hits a 45 degree block, will go left and right indefinitely


## Todo Low Priority
- [TODO] Watch more of those videos
- Level load/save/editor ?
- Maybe add more varieties in sound



## Other Ideas

- Project limits, use no textures, only coloured vertexes?
