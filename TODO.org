- Menu system?
  - Start, exit
- GUI notifications
  - Level n  and ready before start
  - Game over
  - in game pause menu (exit, restart, reset ball)
- Win game sound/message
- [TODO] Rework block rendering (Draw fill then outline, in static buffer)


# Refactor
- see if possible to have sound play commands in one place
- state graph calls to set state and reset timer in one expression


# Bugs
- Ball straight up hits a 45 degree block, will go left and right indefinitely


## Todo Low Priority
- [TODO] Watch more of those videos
- Level load/save/editor ?
- Maybe add more varieties in sound


## Other Ideas

- Project limits, use no textures, only coloured vertexes?
