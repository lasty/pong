- Collision detection
  - [DONE] Simple circle detection
  - [DONE] Rect point collisions
  - [DONE] rect rect collisions
  - [DONE] rect circle collisions
  - [TODO] circle line collision
  - line line collision (needed?)
  - line rect collision (needed?)
  - try rect algorithm with circle line collision
  - force when collided
  - Somehow rework boundaries to new collision detection routines
  - Refactor and clean up code again  (move things to maths, collision routines out of game class)


## Todo Low Priority
- [TODO] Watch more of those videos
- [TODO] Investigate atom clang-format


## Done!



## Other Ideas

- Project limits, use no textures, only coloured vertexes?
