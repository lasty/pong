- [DONE] Win/Lose conditions
  - [DONE] have maximum ball count?
  - [DONE] New level when all blocks cleared
- Change shader to take vertex colours
- Particles class
- Do particles when block destroyed
- Text rendering
  - vector font, like 7 segment display
- [DONE] Have a debug key reset ball (return to ball_launch state)
- Have paddle intersections apply velocity of paddle to the ball
- Win game sound/message
- Rework block rendering (Draw fill then outline, in static buffer)


# Refactor
- Go through and rename badly named functions/variables/enums
- Eliminate commented/dead code
- Have a pass at TODO comments
- see if possible to have sound play commands in one place
- state graph calls to set state and reset timer in one expression


## Todo Low Priority
- [TODO] Watch more of those videos
- [TODO] Investigate atom clang-format
- Level load/save/editor ?
- Maybe add more varieties in sound



## Other Ideas

- Project limits, use no textures, only coloured vertexes?
