- [DONE] command/key to enable debug lines
- [DONE] setup delta time timer in a new class/func (maybe in input?)
- [DONE] Fire up from paddle
  - Get velocity from last (few?) frames, add to ball initial velocity


# Gameish
  - Remove ball from bottom of screen
    - Rework simple collision checks for out of bounds balls
  - Win/Lose conditions
  - New level
  - Level load/save/editor ?


# Refactor
- [DONE] Read/watch: unidirectional user interface architecture
- [TODO] Try to implement Model/View/Intent style system
  - [DONE] Input class should return an intent
  - [DONE] Game/Update should be pure, take an intent, output new state
  - [DONE] Render takes game state


## Todo Low Priority
- [TODO] Watch more of those videos
- [TODO] Investigate atom clang-format
- Particles class
- Do particles when block destroyed
- Maybe add more varieties in sound



## Done!

- [DONE] Change player to paddle rect
- [DONE] Paddle follow mouse cursor X position


## Other Ideas

- Project limits, use no textures, only coloured vertexes?
